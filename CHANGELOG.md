# Updates

## Need to be done
[-] superF4.exe can run in the background and it is the best tool to kill application with CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F4

currently C:\Program Files\sunshine\config\app.json need to be changed to call this CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F4 so need to write an AutoHotDesk.exe

HideUnhideDesktopIcons - CTRL+SHIFT+9

MinimiseWindow - CTRL+SHIFT+5

PageUpDown - CTRL+SHIFT+9

PrintScreen - CTRL+SHIFT+3

KillWindow - CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F4

[-] DumbDrop.exe fails to run on first start. Need to be fixed in DumbDrop.snl
